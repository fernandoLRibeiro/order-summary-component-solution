## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During the development of this project I learned some CSS quirks (such as the font-family property working differently depending on whether it's declared in the 'body' element selector or in the '\*' selector, which in retrospect seems rather obvious, since one selects just the body element and the other selects all elements) and how I should've used CSS variables from the beginning.

### Continued development

I need to look some more into CSS variables, since it is my impression that I only know the very basics and it seems pretty convenient.
